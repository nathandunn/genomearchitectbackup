<h3>I. GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>

<h4 id="general">1. General Process of Manual Annotation</h4>

<p>The major steps of manual annotation using Web Apollo can be
sumarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>locate a chromosomal region of interest</li>
  <li>determine whether a feature in an existing evidence track provides a reasonable gene model to start annotating</li>
  <li>drag the selected feature to the ‘User Annotation’area, creating an initial gene model</li>
  <li>use editing functions to edit the gene model if necessary</li>
  <li>check your edited gene model for consistency with existing
  homologs by exporting the fasta formatted sequence and searching a
  protein sequence database, such as UniProt or the NCBI Non Redundant (NR) database, and</li>
  <li>conducting preliminary functional assignments using the Gene Ontology (GO) database.</li>
</ol>

  <p>When annotating gene models using Web Apollo, remember that you
are looking at a ‘frozen’ version of the genome assembly, and this
means you will not be able to modify the assembled genome sequence itself.</p>

</br>

<h4 id="evdemo">2. Evidence Provided in the Public Demo</h4>

<h3>II. NAVIGATION</h3>

<h4 id="recon">3. Initial reconnaissance and adjustments.</h4>

<h5>3.1 Log in</h5>

<p>To begin annotating a gene, login to the <a
href="http://genomearchitect.org/WebApolloDemo">Web Apollo Demo</a></p>

<p>You may choose to go to the ‘Reference Sequence selection’ screen,
the main entry point for Web Apollo. This page allows users to view
the available reference sequences and perform bulk operations on those
sequences (e.g. exporting data). Alternatively you may jump directly
into edit mode.</p>

<p>If prompted, use the following credentials:</p>
<p>Username | Password: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; demo | demo</p>

</br>

<p><strong>3.1.1 Select the Scaffold, Chromosome or Group to Begin your Work</strong></p>

<p>If you know the identifier of the scaffold (or chromosome, or
group; henceforth referred to as ‘scaffolds’) you wish to work on,
find it under the ‘Name’ list. Scaffolds will be listed in groups of
10, 25, 50 or 100 entries. You may scroll through the options on the
upper left drop-down menu to select your preference and facilitate
your search. The ‘Filter’ box on the upper right allows users to find
their scaffold of interest by entering letters and or numbers from its
identifier. The filter search is not case-sensitive. Once you find the
desired scaffold, click on its highlighted name and the Web Apollo
Main Window will open in a new browser tab.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>3.1.2 Search for a specific sequence</strong></p>

<p> If you do not know the scaffold ID and have the sequence of a
transcript or protein homolog related to your gene of interest, you
might use the ‘Search Sequence’ feature to run a BLAT (BLAST-Like
Alignment Tool) search. Querying the assembled genome using BLAT will
determine the existence of a gene model prediction that is putatively
homologous to your gene of interest. Click the ‘Tools’ item on the Web
Apollo menu bar, and select ‘Sequence Search’ from the dropdown
choices. Choose to run a Protein or Nucleotide BLAT search from the
drop down menu as appropriate, and paste the string of residues to be
used as query. Check the box labeled ‘Search all genomic sequences’ to
search the entire genome.</p>

<p>The existence of paralogs may cause your query to match more than
one scaffold or genomic range. Select the desired genomic range to be
displayed in the Web Apollo Main Window. The result of your query will
be displayed in the browser window behind the search box, highlighted
in yellow. Close the window when you are satisfied with your
results. You may read more about ‘Highlights’ in section 3.2.</p>

<p><strong>A word on Blat:</strong></p> Blat of DNA is designed to
quickly find sequences of 95% and greater similarity of length 40
bases or more, and it may miss more divergent or shorter sequence
alignments. On protein, BLAT finds sequences of 80% and greater
similarity to the query of length 20+ amino acids. Higher speed at the
price of lesser homology depth make Blat a commonly used tool to look
up the location of a sequence in the genome or determine the exon
structure of an mRNA. <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/656.abstract. ">Learn more about Blat here</a>.</p> 

</br>

<h5>3.2 The Web Apollo Main Window</h5>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the Web Apollo annotation
window. The blue bar at the top includes the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>‘File’</em> tab allows users to add any combination of
  data files (e.g. GFF3, BAM, BigWig) and URLs. Web Apollo
  automatically suggests tracks to display their contents. It is also
  possible to combine the information from quantitative tracks into a
  <em>'Combination Track'</em>. Data from tracks containing graphs may be
  compared and combined in an additive, subtractive, or divisive
  arithmetic operation. The resulting track highlights the differences
  between the data. The third option allows users to <em>‘Add sequence
  search track’</em>. This tool creates tracks showing regions of the
  reference sequence (or its translations) that match a given string
  of nucleotides or amino acids residues.</li>
  <li><em>‘View’</em> allows users to color all exons in display
  according to CDS frame, and to toggle the view of the plus and minus
  strands. It is also possible to <em>'Set highlight'</em> over a region by
  selecting this option and marking the region. The highlight option
  will automatically be turned <em>'On'</em> when inspecting the
  results from a BLAT search. Annotators will also use this menu when
  resizing the scale of quantitative tracks.</li>
  <li><em>‘Tools’</em> leads users to perform BLAT searches (see
  section 3.1.2).</li>
  <li>The <em>‘Help’</em> tab includes links to a list of helpful
  commands for Web Apollo, and details about JBrowse.</li>
  <li>The <em>‘Login’</em> option allows users to enter and exit the
  Web Apollo editing tool instance. When logged in, the user name will
  be displayed instead of the word <em>‘Login </em>’.</li>
  <li>The URL from the browser window can be shared with collaborators
  as a permanent link. Web Apollo will display the visible region,
  tracks and highlights that were displayed at the time the URL link
  was captured.</li>
</ul>

<figcaption align="left"><strong>Figure 1. Web Apollo Annotation
Editor Overview.</strong> This view shows an annotation in
progress. The main interface is similar to JBrowse, with available
tracks displayed as a set of tiles along the left side of the main
panel. To turn a track on or off, click the box in front of the track
title from the column on the left. <strong>A.</strong> The
<em>‘Navigation Panel’</em> runs along the top of the main panel; it
includes arrows to move left and right, and two levels of zooming. The
drop-down box is used to select the group (scaffold or chromosome) for
annotation, and the text-box is used to manually enter its
coordinates. <strong>B.</strong> The <em>‘User-created
Annotations’</em> panel contains the manual
annotations. <strong>C.</strong> The <em>‘Evidence’</em> panel
contains the evidence tracks. Annotators create annotations by first
selecting and dragging a model from the <em>‘Evidence’</em> panel to
the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> panel. See more in section
3.2.</figcaption>
</figure>

</br>

<p>The <em>‘Navigation Panel’</em> at the top of the window (Fig 1. A)
houses controls for localization within a chromosome or scaffold,
controls to move to a different scaffold, and a button to select and
<em>‘Highlight a region’</em>.</p>

<p>The light yellow track at the top of the working area is the
<em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> area (Fig 1. B), where users will
drag complete gene models, individual exons, as well as any
non-translated elements to be modified. All transactions performed on
the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> area can be reversed with the
<em>‘Undo’</em> and <em>‘Redo’</em> options. The <em>'History'</em> of
all operations performed on each annotation is also available. To display the menu of
options select the annotation in progress and right-click over it.</p>

<p>A list of <em>‘Available Tracks’</em> is available on the left, and
it is possible to filter the tracks displayed in this list by typing
on the <em>‘filter by text’</em> white box above the track
list. Clicking the box in front of each item in the list of available
tracks will display the track in the <em>‘Evidence’</em> panel (Fig
1. C), allowing visualization data from gene predictions, evidence
sets, and regulatory elements. The track’s label includes a drop-down
menu with options to 1) retrieve information <em>‘About this
track’</em>; 2) an option to <em>‘Pin to top’</em> that leaves the
track displayed at the top of the screen and below the
<em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> track as users scroll down to
inspect other data; 3) the <em>‘Edit config’</em> option to bring up
an editing window and modify the JSON file to configure the track’s
display; and options to 4) <em>‘Delete’</em> the track or 5) <em>‘Save
track data’</em> into GFF3 format. More information about the
available tracks and how the data are processed for display can be
found in the JBrowse Configuration Guide at
http://www.gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide.</p>

</br>

<h3>III. ANNOTATION</h3>

<p>Web Apollo allows annotators to modify and refine the precise
location and structure of the genome elements that predictive
algorithms cannot yet resolve automatically. Using Web Apollo
annotators may corroborate or modify the structures of coding genes,
pseudogenes, repeat regions, transposable elements, and non-coding
RNAs (i.e: snRNA, snoRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and miRNA).</p>

</br>

<h4 id="annotate">4. Annotating a gene</h4>

<h5>4.1 Initiating an annotation</h5>

<p>If you have not already performed a Blat search to identify your
gene of interest (see section 3.1.2), you may do so at this point
using the <em>‘Sequence search’</em> feature from the <em>‘Tools’</em>
tab on the menu bar. You may also navigate along the scaffold using
the navigation arrows. Your gene of interest may appear on the forward
(sense) or reverse (anti-sense) strand. Gene predictions are labeled
with identifiers, and users may retrieve additional information by
selecting the entire model and using the right-click menu to select
the <em>‘View details’</em> item.</p>

<p>After locating your gene of interest, add as many gene prediction
and evidence tracks as you consider necessary to inform your
annotation by dragging and dropping them from the list of
<em>‘Available Tracks’</em> on the left. Scroll through the different
tracks of gene predictions and choose one that you consider most
closely reflects the actual structure of the gene. It is also possible
to filter the tracks displayed in this list by typing on the
<em>‘filter by text’</em> box. You may base your decision on prior
knowledge of the reliability of each gene prediction track (e.g.,
select an evidence-based gene model instead of an ab initio gene
prediction). Alternatively, you may compare the gene prediction tracks
to a BLAST alignment or other aligned data (e.g.: alignments of
protein homologs, cDNAs and, RNAseq reads). To highlight your
preferred gene model, double click on any exon or click on one of the
introns to select the entire gene model. You may also choose exons
from two or more separate tracks of evidence.  Drag the highlighted
model or all pieces of evidence into the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> area.</p> 

<p>At this point you may download the protein sequence (see section
4.3.1) to query a protein database and help you determine if the
selected gene model is, biologically speaking, an accurate
approximation to the gene. For example, you may perform a protein
sequence search of UniProt or NCBI’s non-redundant peptide database,
NR. If you have knowledge of protein domains in your gene of interest,
you may perform a protein domain search of the InterPro databases to
verify that your selected gene model contains the expected domains. If
further investigation suggests that you have not selected the best
gene model to start annotating, delete it by highlighting it (as
above) and using the <em>‘Delete’</em> function from the right-click
menu.</p>

<p>Once a gene model is selected as the best starting point for
annotation, the annotator must decide whether it needs further
modification. Protein or domain database searches may have already
informed this decision. Scroll down the evidence tracks to see if
splice sites in transcript alignments agree with the selected gene
model, or if evidence suggests addition or modification of an exon is
necessary. Transcript alignments (e.g. cDNA/EST/RNASeq tracks) that
are significantly longer than the gene model may indicate the presence
of additional coding sequence or untranslated regions (UTRs). Keep in
mind that transcript alignments may be shorter than the gene model due
to the fragmented nature of current transcript sequencing
technologies. Similarly, protein alignments may not reflect the entire
length of the coding region because divergent regions may not align
well, resulting in a short protein alignment or one with gaps. Protein
and transcript alignments in regions with tandem, closely related
genes might also be problematic, with partial alignments to one gene,
then skipping over to align the rest to a second gene.</p>

</br>

<h5>4.2 Simple Cases</h5>

<p>In this guide, a <em>‘simple case’</em> occurs when the predicted
gene model is correct or nearly correct, and this model is supported
by evidence that mostly or completely agrees with the
prediction. Evidence that extends beyond the predicted model is
assumed to be non-coding sequence. The following sections describe
simple modifications.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.2.1 Add UTRs</strong></p>

<p>Gene predictions may or may not include UTRs. If transcript
alignment data are available and extend beyond your original
annotation, you may add or extend UTRs. To do this, users may
implement edge-matching options to <em>‘Set as 5’ end’</em>, <em>‘Set
as 3’ end’</em>, or <em>‘Set as both ends’</em> from the right-click
menu. To use these options, select the exon that needs to be extended,
then keep the ‘Shift’ key down as you select the exon from the track
of evidence displaying the expected UTR (given the evidence), then use
the right click menu to choose the appropriate option to extend to the
desired UTR. Alternatively this operation can be performed manually by
positioning the cursor at the edge of the exon that needs to be
extended, then using the right-click to display the menu and choosing
the <em>‘Zoom to base level’</em> option. Place the cursor over the
edge of the exon (5’ or 3’ end exon as needed) until it becomes a
black arrow (Fig. 2), then click and drag the edge of the exon to the
new coordinate position that includes the UTR. To add a new, spliced
UTR to an existing annotation follow the procedure for adding an exon,
as detailed in section 4.3.3.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.2.2 Exon Structure Integrity</strong></p>

<p>Zoom in sufficiently to clearly resolve each exon as a distinct
rectangle. When two exons from different tracks share the same start
and/or end coordinates, a red bar appears at the edge of the
exon. Visualize this edge-matching function by either selecting the
whole annotation or one exon at a time. Scrolling along the length of
the annotation exon boundaries may be verified against available EST
data. Use the square bracket keys <strong>[</strong> and
<strong>]</strong> to jump to the next exon splice junction or coding
sequence (CDS). The curly bracket keys <strong>{</strong> and
<strong>}</strong> allow users to jump to the next transcript. Check
whether there are any ESTs or transcript data contigs, or any RNASeq
reads showing evidence that one or more of the annotated exons are
missing, or include additional exons.</p>

<p>To correct an exon boundary to match data in the evidence tracks
use the edge-matching options from the right-click menu as described
in 4.2.1. Alternatively you may <em>‘Zoom to base level'</em>, click
on the exon to select it and place the cursor over the edge of the
exon; when the cursor changes to an arrow, drag the edge of the exon
to the desired new coordinates.</p>

<p>In some cases all the data may disagree with the annotation, in
other cases some data support the annotation and some of the data
support one or more alternative transcripts. Try to annotate as many
alternatives transcripts as the evidence data support.</p>

<p>In most Eukaryotes the majority of splice sites at the exon/intron
boundaries appear as <strong>5’-…exon]GT/AG[exon…-3’</strong>. All
other splice sites are here called <em>‘non-canonical’</em> and are
indicated in Web Apollo with an orange circle with a white exclamation
point inside, placed over the edge of the offending exon. When
alternative transcripts are added, be sure to inspect each splice
transcript to check for any changes  that the changes.</p>

<p>If a non-canonical splice site is present, zoom to base level to
review it. Not all non-canonical splice sites must be corrected, and
in such cases they should be flagged with the appropriate
comment. (Adding a <em>‘Comment’</em> is addressed in Section
5). Prior knowledge about the organism of interest may help the user
decide whether a predicted non-canonical splice site is likely to be
real. For instance, GC splice donors have been observed in many
organisms, but less frequently than the GT splice donors described
above. As mentioned above Web Apollo flags GC splice donors as
non-canonical. To further complicate the problem, splice sites that
are non-canonical, but found in nature, such as GC donors, may not be
recognized by some gene prediction algorithms. In such cases a gene
prediction algorithm that does not recognize GC splice donors may have
ignored a true GC donor and selected another non-canonical splice site
that is less frequently observed in nature. Therefore, if a
non-canonical splice site that is rarely observed in nature is
present, you may wish to search the region for a more frequent
in-frame non-canonical splice site, such as a GC donor. If there is a
close in-frame site that is more likely to be the correct splice
donor, make this adjustment while zoomed at base level. To assist in
the decision to modify a splice site, download the translated
sequences and use them to search well-curated protein databases, such
as UniProt, to see if you can resolve the question using protein
alignments. Incorrect splice sites would likely cause gaps in the
alignments. If there does not appear to be any way to resolve the
non-canonical splice, leave it and add a comment.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.2.4 <em>'Start'</em> and <em>'Stop'</em> Sites.</strong>

<p>By default, Web Apollo will calculate the longest possible open
reading frame (ORF) that includes canonical <em>'Start'</em> and
<em>'Stop'</em> signals within the predicted exons. To check for
accuracy of <em>'Start'</em> and <em>'Stop'</em> signals, you may
align the translated sequence to a known protein database, such as
UniProt, to determine whether the ends of the protein sequence
corresponds with those of known proteins.</p>

<p>If it appears that Web Apollo did not calculate the correct
<em>'Start'</em> signal, the user can modify it. To set the
<em>'Start'</em> codon manually, position the cursor over the first
nucleotide of the candidate <em>'Start'</em> codon and select the
<em>‘Set translation start’</em> option from the right-click
menu. Depending on evidence from a protein database search or
additional evidence tracks, you may wish to select an in-frame Start
codon further up or downstream. An upstream <em>'Start'</em> codon may
be present outside the predicted gene model, within a region supported
by another evidence track. See section 4.3.3 on how to <em>‘Add an
exon’</em>. When necessary, it is also possible to <em>'Set translation
end'</em> from the right-click menu.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>'Start'</em> codon may also be located in a
non-predicted exon further upstream. If you cannot identify that exon,
add the appropriate comment (using the transcript comment section in
the <em>‘Comments’</em> table of the <em>‘Information Editor’</em> as
described in section 6).</p>

<p>In rare cases, the actual <em>'Start'</em> codon may be
non-canonical (non-ATG). Check whether a non-canonical
<em>'Start'</em> codon is usually present in homologs of this gene,
and/or check whether this is a likely occurrence in this organism. If
appropriate, you may override the predicted <em>'Start'</em> by
manually setting it to a non-canonical <em>'Start'</em> codon,
choosing the one that most closely reflects what you know about the
protein, and has the best support from the biological evidence
tracks. Add the appropriate comment (using the transcript comment
section in the <em>‘Comments’</em> table of the <em>‘Information
Editor’</em> as described in section 6).</p>

<p>In some cases, a <em>'Stop'</em> codon may not be automatically
identified. Check to see if there are data supporting a 3’ extension
of the terminal exon or additional 3’ exons with valid splice
sites. See section 4.3.3 on how to <em>‘Add an exon’</em>. Each time
you add an exon region, whether by extending an existent exon or
adding a new one, Web Apollo recalculates the longest ORF to identity
<em>'Start'</em> and <em>'Stop'</em> signals, allowing you to
determine whether a Stop codon has been incorporated after each
editing step.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.2.5 Predicted Protein Products.</strong>

<p>If any of your manipulations have thrown an exon out of frame, or
caused other drastic changes to the translated sequence, Web Apollo
will warn you by changing the display of from a light-blue
protein-coding stretch to a truncated model shown as a darker blue,
narrower rectangle.</p>

<p>If the annotation looks good, obtain the protein sequence (see
section 4.3.1) and use it to search a protein database, such as
UniProt or NCBI NR. Keep in mind that the best Blast hit may be the
exact prediction from which you initiated your annotation; you should
not consider the identical protein from your organism as external
evidence supporting the annotation. Instead, look at alignments to
proteins from other organisms.</p>

width="150" height="335" alt="Additional Functionality" />
<figcaption align="middle"><strong>Figure 3. Additional
functionality.</strong>This is the right-click menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

</br>

<p><strong>4.3.1 Get Sequences</strong></p>

<p>Select one or more exons, or an entire gene model of interest, and
retrieve the right-click menu to select the <em>‘Get sequence’</em>
feature. Chose from the options to obtain protein, cDNA, CDS or
genomic sequences.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.3.2 Merge Exons, Merge Transcripts</strong></p>

<p>Select each of the joining exons while holding down the
<em>Shift</em> key, open the right-click menu and select the
<em>‘Merge’</em> option.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.3.3 Add an Exon</strong></p>

<p>You may select and drag the putative new exon from a track in the
<em>‘Evidence’</em> panel and add it directly to an annotated
transcript in the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> area. Click the
exon and, holding your finger on the mouse button, drag the cursor
until it touches the receiving transcript. The receiving transcript
will be highlighted in dark green when it is okay to release the mouse
button. When the mouse button is released the additional exon becomes
attached to the receiving transcript. If the receiving transcript is
on the opposite strand from the one where you selected the new exon, a
warning dialog box will ask you to confirm the change.</p>

<p>As described before, Web Apollo dynamically recalculates the
longest ORF for each model, so you must check whether adding one or
more exons disrupts the reading frame, inserts premature
<em>'Stop'</em> signals, etc.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.3.4 Make an Intron, Split an Exon</strong></p>

<p>Select the <em>‘Make intron’</em> option from the right-click menu over an
exon will identify the nearest canonical splice sites
<strong>(5’-…exon]GT/AG[exon…-3’)</strong> to modify the model, and Web Apollo will
also recalculate the longest ORF. If Web Apollo cannot find a set of
canonical splice sites within the selected exon, a dialog box will
appear with a warning.</p>


<p>If everything you know about the model indicates that an exon
should not be preserved in its current form, you may manually disrupt
the exon using the <em>‘Split’</em> option from the right-click menu,
which creates a 1-nucleotide intron without taking into account
whether or not the surrounding splice sites are canonical.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.3.5 Delete an Exon</strong></p>

<p>Select the exon using a single click (double click selects the
entire model), and select the ‘Delete’ option from the right-click
menu. Check whether deleting one or more exons disrupts the reading
frame, inserts premature Stop signals, etc.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.3.6 Flip the Strand of Annotation</strong></p>

<p>At times transcript alignments may appear on the strand opposite to
the model’s coding strand, particularly when the transcript alignment
does not include a splice junction, which makes it difficult to
determine the coding direction. If aligned evidence is used to
initiate an annotation, and it is later determined that the annotation
is on the incorrect strand, the user may choose the <em>‘Flip
strand’</em> option from the right-click menu to reverse the
orientation of the annotation. As mentioned before, annotators should
always reassess the integrity of the translation after modifying an
annotation.</p>

</br>

<h5>4.4 Complex Cases</h5>

<p><strong>4.4.1 Merge Two Gene Predictions on the Same Scaffold</strong></p>

<p>Evidence may support the merge of two (or more) different gene
models. To begin the annotation select all the gene models that you
would like to merge, then drag them from the <em>‘Evidence’</em> panel
onto the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> area. Be aware that
protein alignments may not be a useful starting point because these
may have incorrect splice sites and may lack non-conserved
regions.</p>

<p>You may select the supporting evidence tracks and drag their
<em>‘ghost’</em> over the candidate models (without releasing them) to
corroborate the overlap. Additionally, zoom in and carefully review
edge-matching (Figure 4) and coverage across models. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you may select and drag each proposed gene model
separately onto the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> area. Once you
are certain that two models should be merged, after checking
boundaries and all supporting evidence, bring them together by holding
the <em>‘Shift’</em> key and clicking on an intron from each of the
merging gene models; in this way you will select both models
completely. Then select the <em>‘Merge’</em> option from the
right-click menu. Get the resulting translation sequence and inspect
it by querying a protein database, such as UniProt. Be sure to record
the IDs of all starting gene models in the <em>‘Comments’</em> table,
and use the appropriate canned comment to indicate that this
annotation is the result of a merge.</p>

<figcaption align="left"><strong>Figure 4. Edge-matching in Web
Apollo.</strong> When a feature is selected, the exon edges are marked
with a red box. All other features that share the same exon boundaries
are marked with a red line on the matching edge. This feature allows
annotators to confirm that evidence is in agreement without examining
each exon at the base level.</figcaption>
</figure>

</br>

<p><strong>4.4.2 Merge Two Gene Predictions from Different Scaffolds</strong></p>

<p>It is not possible to merge two annotations across scaffolds, however annotators should document the fact that the data support a merge in the <em>‘Comments’</em> table for both components. For standardization purposes, please use the following two prepared (canned) comments, adding the name of both models in every case:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>"RESULT OF: merging two or more gene models across
  scaffolds"</em></li>
  <li><em>"RESULT OF: merging two or more gene models. Gene models
  involved in merge:"</em></li>
</ul>

</br>

<p><strong>4.4.3 Split a Gene Prediction</strong></p>

<p>When different segments of a predicted protein align to two or more
different families of protein homologs, and when the predicted protein
does not align to any known protein over its entire length, one or
more splits may be recommended. Transcript data may show evidence in
support of a split; be sure to verify that it is not a case of
alternative transcripts! A split can be created in one of two ways: 1)
select the flanking exons using the right-click menu option
<em>‘Split’</em>, or 2) annotate each resulting fragment
independently. You should obtain the resulting translation, and check
it by searching a protein database, such as UniProt. Be sure to record
the original ID for both annotations in the <em>‘Comments’</em>
section.</p>

</br>

<p><strong>4.4.4 Frameshifts, Single base Errors, and Selenocysteine-containing Products</strong></p>

<p>Web Apollo allows annotators to make single base modifications or
frameshifts that are reflected in the sequence and structure of any
transcripts overlapping the modification. Note that these
manipulations do NOT change the underlying genomic sequence. Changes
are made on the DNA track with the right-click menu.</p>

<p>If you determine that you need to make one of these changes, zoom
in to the nucleotide level, and right-click over the genomic sequence
to access the menu with options for introducing sequence changes such
as insertions, deletions or substitutions. The selected nucleotide
must be the starting point for each modification.</p>

<p>The <em>‘Create Genomic Insertion’</em> option requires a string of
nucleotide residues that will be inserted to the right of the cursor’s
current coordinate. The <em>‘Create Genomic Deletion’</em> option
requires the length of the deletion, starting with the nucleotide
where the cursor is positioned. When using the <em>‘Create Genomic
Substitution’</em> option, enter the string of nucleotide residues
that will replace the ones on the DNA track.</p>

<p>Once you have entered the modifications, Web Apollo will
recalculate the corrected transcript and protein sequences, which can
be obtained selecting the ‘Get Sequence’ option from the right-click
menu. Since the underlying genomic sequence is reflected in all
annotations that include the modified region you should alert the
curators of your organism’s database using the <em>‘Comments’</em>
section to report these CDS edits.</p>

<p>It is also possible to annotate special cases such as
selenocysteine-containing proteins, or read-through <em>‘Stop’</em>
signals using the right-click menu and selecting the <em>‘Set
readthrough stop codon’</em> option. The current TGA <em>‘Stop’</em>
exon will be highlighted in purple, and the next <em>‘Stop’</em>
signal in frame will be used as the end of translation. Note that Web
Apollo will automatically add the remaining amino acids to the
resulting sequence. Add a comment to the <em>‘Comments’</em> section
for this transcript to include this modification.</p>

</br>

<h4 id="ncregions">5. Annotating Repeat Regions, Transposable Elements, and Non-coding (nc) RNAs</h4>

<p>Web Apollo allows users to annotate a variety of ncRNAs and other
regulatory elements.</p>

<p>If you don’t know the location of the feature you wish to annotate,
perform a Blat search to identify the sequence of interest using the
<em>‘Sequence search’</em> feature from the <em>‘Tools’</em> tab on
the menu bar (see also section 3.1.2). You may also navigate along the
scaffold using the navigation arrows. All non-coding elements are
labeled with identifiers, and users may retrieve additional
information by selecting the feature and using the right menu to
select the <em>‘View details’</em> item.</p>

<p>Once the feature and track of interest are located in the
<em>‘Evidence’</em> panel, select it and use right click over the
desired feature, and choose the <em>‘Create New Annotation’</em>
option to start an annotation. After the user chooses an element from
the menu, the new annotation appears in the <em>‘User-created
Annotations’</em> track. The type of annotation for any annotations
already present in the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em> cannot be
changed.</p>

<p>Modifications such as editing boundaries, duplicating, and deleting
the annotation, as well as the <em>‘History’</em>, <em>‘Redo’</em> and
<em>‘Undo’</em> functions, are possible for all non-coding
features. Additional modifications such as <em>‘Split’</em> and
<em>‘Make intron’</em> are also possible for ncRNAs.</p>

<p>All metadata about the annotation should be added using the
<em>‘Information Editor’</em>, as described in section 6.</p>

</br>

<h4 id="infoeditor">6. The Information Editor</h4>

<p>Information about the <em>‘Name’</em>, <em>‘Symbol’</em>, and <em>‘Description’</em> for a
Gene, Transcript, repeat region, transposable element, or non-coding
RNAs can be modified in the <em>‘Information Editor’</em>. There is also an
option to report to the lead curators, informing them whether a manual
annotation needs to be reviewed (<em>‘Needs review’</em>), or has already been
<em>‘Approved’</em> using the <em>‘Status’</em> buttons. Users will also be able to
input information about their annotations in fields that capture 1)
<em>‘Comments’</em> on the process of annotation, 2) crossed references to
other databases in <em>‘DBXRefs’</em>, 3) additional <em>‘Attributes’</em> in a
<em>‘tag/value’</em> format that pertain to the annotation, 4) references to
any published data in the PubMed database using <em>‘Pubmed IDs’</em>, and 5)
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, which can be added typing text or GO
identifiers. The auto-complete function will retrieve the desired
information. A drop-down menu at the top of the <em>‘Information Editor’</em>
allows users to switch between isoforms while editing these
metadata.</p>

<p>All the information captured in these tables will be incorporated
into the exported files of the <em>‘User-created Annotations’</em>, and will
appear in Column 9 of the GFF3 that is generated.</p>

</br>

<h5>6.1 Add Comments</h5>

<p>When you are satisfied with your annotation, you may provide
additional information in the form of <em>‘Comments’</em>. For example, the ID
of the gene prediction that you used to initiate the annotation
presents useful information for your database curators. Functional
information obtained from homologs may also be useful, e.g. homolog
ID, description, gene name, gene symbol. You should also indicate the
type of changes made to the annotation, and whether a gene is split
across scaffolds, as described in previous sections.</p>

<p>For each annotated element first click to select it, then use the
right-click option to select <em>‘Information Editor’</em> from the menu. In
the case of coding genes, pseudogenes, and ncRNAs the <em>‘Information
Editor’</em> window displays information for both the gene and the
transcript; users should determine whether the comment is more
appropriate for the gene (e.g. a change in the gene symbol) or an
individual transcript (e.g. type of alterations made). In the case of
repetitive elements and transposable elements, the <em>‘Information
Editor’</em> window has only one column.</p>

<p>In the <em>‘Information Editor’</em> window click on the respective <em>‘Add’</em>
button to start a new comment; a new row, labeled as ‘Enter new
comment’, will appear. One click on this row reveals a drop-down menu
option on the right, which displays canned comments to choose if they
are available for your organism of interest. Alternatively, it is also
possible to type custom comments. To edit an existing comment, click
over the comment and begin typing, or replace it with a different
canned comment. Comments that are no longer relevant or useful may be
removed using the <em>‘Delete’</em> button at the bottom of the box.</p>

</br>

<h5>6.2 Add Database Crossed-references, PubMed IDs, and GO IDs</h5>

<p>When available, users should also include information to
cross-referenced databases by adding the name of the database and the
corresponding accession number for each gene or transcript to the
<em>‘DBXRefs’</em> tables, respectively. Any additional information regarding
published information in support of this annotation (e.g. whether the
gene has already been part of a publication) should be included by
adding a <em>'PubMed ID'</em> using the provided field, and available functional
information should be added using GO IDs as appropriate. The process to add
information to these tables is the same as described for the
<em>‘Comments’</em> tables.</p>

</br>

<h5>6.3 Add Attributes</h5>

<p>Any additional information about the gene model or transcript that
can be included in the form of a <em>‘tag/value’</em> entry, and provides
further evidence in support of the manual annotation can be captured
on the <em>‘Attributes’</em> table. The process to add information to these
tables is the same as described for the <em>‘Comments’</em>
tables.</p>

</br>

<h4 id="saving">7. (No need for) Saving your Annotations</h4>

<p>Web Apollo immediately saves your work, automatically recording it
on the database. Because of this, your work will not be lost in the
event of network disruptions, and no further actions are required in
order to save your work.</p>

</br>

<h4 id="export">8. Exporting Data</h4>

<p>The user-created annotations may be exported as GFF3 or FASTA
formatted files. These operations may be done for either a single
scaffold, or to include user-created annotations from the entire
assembled genome. To export the user-created annotations from a single
scaffold, click on the track labeled <em>‘User-created Annotations </em>’, then
click on the <em>‘Save track data’</em> option, and choose either the <em>‘GFF3’</em> or
<em>‘FASTA’</em> options. To export GFF3, FASTA, or Chado formatted files from
one or more scaffolds, or from the entire assembly, you may also go to
the scaffold selection page and select all scaffolds of
interest. Click on the <em>‘File’</em> menu at the top, and hover the mouse
over the word <em>‘Export’</em> to choose one of the options available. Menu
items for <em>‘GFF3’</em>, <em>‘FASTA’</em>, and <em>‘Chado’</em> will appear in your screen.</p>

<p>Data from each of the evidence and prediction tracks can also be
exported. GFF3 formatted files of the visible region on the Web Apollo
screen, as well as files containing data from the entire
scaffold/chromosome can be exported. The data will be formatted
according to the original data used to display each track. For
instance, RNA-Seq reads could be exported either as GFF3 or BED file
formats.</p>

</br>
